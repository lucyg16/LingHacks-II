Project: Psychologist assistant

This project utilizes text input describing certain symptoms for psychological disorders.
Using sentiment analysis, the program will be able to detect certain moods from key words
and reduce the input to short and concise descriptions of symptoms. This ambiguity of the input
is in the way the patient describes what he/she is feeling. Using the datbase connected to the 
algorithm, the algorithm will be able to use data from sentiment analysis and input file to 
output a diagnosed disorder.
